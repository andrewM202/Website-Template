# Website-Template
A template for a website I made in my free time. The original idea was to make a sort of directory for countries, where you could click on a card, in a card based layout, which would then take you to a new html file with all the information on that country inside.

Features
- Card based layout
- Night mode / day mode button
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Media queries used for different sized devices
